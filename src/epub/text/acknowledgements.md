This book is dedicated to Fremont Older, to 
Judge Frank H. Dunne, to the unnamed friend 
who sawed me out of the San Francisco jail and 
to that dirty, drunken, disreputable, crippled
beggar, “Sticks” Sullivan, who picked the buckshot 
out of my back—under the bridge—at Baraboo, 
Wisconsin. 

The Author.
